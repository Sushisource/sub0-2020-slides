                # Blockchain for Squares

                [Spencer Judge](mailto://spencer@tpfs.io) - [Transparent Systems](https://www.transparentsystems.com/)

                Notes:
                * Hi! I'm Spencer Judge, an Engineer at Transparent Systems. I work primarily on
                  our blockchain implementation, and services that surround it.
                * Today, I'll be talking a little bit about what Transparent Systems does, and how
                  we leverage Substrate to help do it.
                * I'll also spend some time on how we strike a balance between the existing financial
                  system and the world of blockchain and crypto.

                ## What is Transparent Systems?

                * We're developing software for on-demand, fee-free, 24/7 settlement of USD
                * Why? Cash settlements are still constrained by limited banking hours and costly transaction fees.
                * Backed by Pantera, Square, Future\Perfect, IDEO, Digital Currency Group, CMT Digital, Vulcan.

                Notes:
                * We want to provide near-instant settlement of fiat USD.
                * Can transfer large sums of money, not limited to small amounts like Venmo or Zelle, etc.
                * Hence usable by businesses for routine settlement.
                * We think, as I'm sure you're all aware, that the financial system is horribly
                  outdated and inefficient. We also think that it can be substantially improved
                  without remaking the world.
                * The lack of innovation in the financial space (until recently) has been shocking.
                  What I meant when I talked about "striking a balance" is that we believe the time
                  is ripe to provide faster, cheaper financial tools that fit into the existing
                  financial machinery rather than trying to tear it down first.
                * Blockchain is clearly an interesting candidate to support this type of innovation,
                  but we think few organizations have tried to provide a seamless integration with
                  traditional mechanisms, and we think Substrate is a great platform to innovate on
                  top of.

                ## Who wants faster, cheaper settlement?

                Everyone. Particularly, businesses with substantial cashflow.

                Notes:
                * To clarify - when I say "settlement", imagine a retail institution like a bagel
                  shop. They have suppliers, like the person who they buy flour from. The bagel
                  maker receiving the flour isn't directly paying the deliveryman - rather the two
                  businesses keep a record of outstanding debt that is occasionally "settled". In this
                  case, by the bagel maker paying the flour maker.
                * Our goal is to help these businesses replace their existing settlement mechanisms
                  as simply and as "transparent"ly as possible.
                * This means we will be interacting a *lot* with businesses that have little-to-no
                  technical knowhow or ability. In other words, "squares", per the title of the talk.
                * Often the person in charge of that purchasing decision is going to be a CFO or
                  accountant, and they're unlikely to be a tech expert.

                ### What do squares* care about?
                * Stability of value - no (un)stablecoins
                * Legality - auditable, compliant
                * Convenience / Ease-of-use
                * Security
                * Cost effectiveness
                * Liquidity

                *square - a person considered to be old-fashioned or boringly conventional in attitude or behavior. <!-- .element: style="font-size: 0.5em; font-style: italic" -->

                Notes:
                * Stability & legality are simply table-stakes to be used by most businesses.
                * Stablecoins have a shaky history thus far at best, especially those backed by
                  a basket of instruments.
                * Convenience is incredibly important. Users simply will not adopt things that
                  are hard to use, even if they're "better" functionally or philosophically.
                * They *really* don't care about your philosophy.
                * Liquidity refers to how "available" funds are - cash is completely liquid, it
                  can be used immediately for almost any purpose. Stocks, for example, are still
                  quite liquid, but less so - you must first find a buyer before you can convert
                  them into cash. Bitcoin's long confirmation times, for example, make it
                  less liquid than one might desire.

                ### Things squares do *not* care about
                #### Even if they probably should

                * What a "private key" is
                * How a blockchain works
                * Independence from the currency of their home country
                * Cryptoeconomics

                Notes:
                * You can make some really great arguments that they should care about these things!
                  Unfortunately, they don't, and you probably won't change their mind.
                * Why would using a blockchain be a selling point to these people? They don't, but
                  they do indirectly because it can make some of the things on the previous slide
                  possible in ways they weren't before.
                * You can only sell your philosophy *after* you have already made their lives
                  easier. I used to work at Tableau Software, and that's a perfect example. For
                  the unfamiliar, Tableau sells visual analytics software. Our "philosophy" involved
                  teaching people that humans understand visuals better than they understand text
                  tables, but to get them to believe that, you had to make their lives demonstrably
                  easier first - then later you could convince them to leave the text tables.
                * I think we've seen a number of efforts in the blockchain and crypto space that
                  are motivated by how powerful the technology is, or how theoretically ideal the
                  economics are, and those are really admirable goals - but the unfortunate reality
                  is that the huge majority of people on earth are perfectly fine with centrally
                  controlled and monitored financial systems, because those systems allow them to
                  live their day-to-day lives. People are more interested in improvements that don't
                  require them to change their habits.

                ### How do we expose an easy interface for our customers?

                ![spongebob apis](spongebob_apis.png) <!-- .element: style="max-width: 30%" -->

                * Our customers are both end-customers, and other teams in the company.
                * Not all devs have deep blockchain or crypto knowledge
                * Support varying levels of sophistication in interactions with API

                Notes:
                * I'm going to talk a little bit about the design of an API we have built on
                  top of our substrate implementation
                * Supporting automation against our platform is the goal
                * We want to empower customers to pick how they manage access to funds
                * This means they can choose to construct and sign transactions completely by
                  themselves if they desire, or they can use our software to handle construction
                  and authentication followed by signing (potentially using an HSM or other keystore)

                ### Show me
                ![api diagram](Sub0_TPFS_Api.svg)
                <!-- .element: style="max-width: 100%; background: gray" -->

                Notes:
                * Here's an overall view of how other services we author and our customers might
                  author interact with the network.
                * The main entry point for most communication is the TPFS api, this is the
                  service that really handles translating the simple business world to the
                  complex blockchain world
                * You'll notice we use gRPC to connect to it. This strikes a nice balance of high
                  performance (compared to something like REST) while still being widely understood
                  by many existing potential customers. It also means we can autogenerate clients
                  for new languages, and we get wire-level compatability for free.
                * We have built Rust and TypeScript clients that thinly wrap the generated grpc
                  client to provide more ergonomics
                * The TPFS API can connect to substrate using JSON RPC either via websockets or
                  in memory. This is nice if you'd like to run it separately.
                * The TPFS API also can perform authentication, which in the future will integrate
                  with standard enterprise authentication systems. It guards access to the keys, which
                  can be behind an HSM or cloud-managed solution, retrieving them as-needed to sign transactions.
                  One of the really nice aspects of this approach is that it allows customers to do role-based
                  authentication of access to their funds. For example, Joe might be able to send any amount under
                  $1000 while the CFO Bob is allowed to transfer any amount.
                * You might be wondering what petri is - it's another service we created that
                  caches historical data that may not be easily accessible from substrate directly.
                  For example, the transaction history of a particular address, which isn't easy
                  to implement as an extension to the substrate JSON api.

                  It uses a full or light substrate client to do this. Currently we are embedding
                  both it and the TPFS-API into full nodes.

                  Right now this petri is just a straightforward cache, but eventually it may also
                  write to a SQL database for analytics purposes. The overall design allows for
                  any sort of constantly running transform-and-backup procedure, and supports
                  backfilling on startup.
                * This setup allows you to create either a lite or full client capable of performing
                  TPFS operations

                * Let me preface this by saying I think the level of detail the substrate RPC API

                but rather that customizing things for your use cases is very good!
                * Now our customers don't need to understand the SCALE encoding and they don't need
                  to know the names of things in the substrate runtime
